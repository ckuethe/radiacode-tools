# Radiacode Tools

Just some things for working with my RadiaCode-102 from Scan-Electronics.

### calibrate.py
This tool computes calibration factors for mapping the channel to detected
photon energy. 

Use `calibrate.py -W` to generate a example calibration file, then use your
detector to measure a range of photon energies.

```
usage: calibrate.py [-h] [-z] [-f FILE] [-o N] [-p N] [-W]

options:
  -h, --help                   show this help message and exit
  -z, --zero-start             Add a synthetic (0,0) calibration data point
  -f FILE, --cal-file FILE     Calibration data file [radiacode.json]
  -o N, --order N              Calibration polynomial order [2]
  -p N, --precision N          Number of decimal places in calibration factors [8]
  -W, --write-template         Generate a template calibration file

```

Calibration can be performed with a single sample (Th-232, Ra-226), though better
results may be obtained using more isotopes with a broader range of energies.

### n42convert.py
This tool converts a RadiaCode ("RC") spectrum XML file into
[ANSI N42](https://www.nist.gov/pml/radiation-physics/ansiieee-n4242-2020-version)
format for analysis with other tools such as
[InterSpec](https://github.com/sandialabs/InterSpec).

```
usage: n42convert.py [-h] -i NAME [-b NAME] [-o NAME | -r] [--overwrite] [-u UUID]

options:
  -h, --help                    show this help message and exit
  -i NAME, --input NAME         primary source data file
  -b NAME, --background NAME    Retrieve background from this file, using the background series if it exists or the main series otherwise.
  -o NAME, --output NAME        [<foreground>.n42]
  -r, --recursive               if given, treat the input path as a directory to process recursively with autogenerated output names
  --overwrite                   allow existing file to be overwritten
  -u UUID, --uuid UUID          specify a UUID for the generated document. [<random>]

```

Only a single `-i` or `--input` argument is required. This will convert the
contents of an RC spectrum file into an N42 file named similarly to the source file.
If the RC file contains an included background spectrum it will be included in the
output.

If the `-r` or `--recursive` argument is given, the input argument is treated as a
directory to traverse looking for RC files to be converted. This argument causes
the background argument to be ignored, and is mutually exclusive with the output
argument; output file name will be generated from each input filename.

In cases where two separate spectra have been recorded, they can be combined to form
a recording with included background. Consider a basement lab with a smoke detector;
the background radiation may be influenced by the concrete foundation made with an
aggregate containing a relatively large amount of thorium and uranium, there may be
elevated levels of radon due to poor ventilation, and the smoke detector contains an
americium source.

A recording of this ambient radiation can be saved as `lab.xml`.
When a new sample arrives, perhaps a container of sodium-free salt substitute (`KCl`)
or a crate of bananas for scale, it is measured in the same location as the lab
reference measurement, and the recording may be saved as `k40.xml`. These two files
may be merged by running `n42convert.py -f k40.xml -b lab.xml -o banana.n42`.

If the background RC file has both foreground and background spectra, the background
spectrum will be copied into the output N42 file. If no background spectrum exists,
the foreground data from the background file will be copied into the output N42 file.

### n42validate.py
```
usage: n42validate.py [-h] [-r] [-q] [-v] [-V] [-s XSD] [-u URL] [-x EXT] FILE [FILE ...]

positional arguments:
  FILE                  source data file

options:
  -h, --help                  show this help message and exit
  -r, --recursive             treat the input path as a directory to process recursively [False]
  -q, --quiet                 don't display the invalid XML element
  -v, --verbose               display valid files too, by default only invalid files are reported
  -V, --valid-only            only display valid files
  -s XSD, --schema-file XSD   Default: ~/.cache/n42.xsd
  -u URL, --schema-url URL    Default: https://www.nist.gov/document/n42xsd
  -x EXT, --extension EXT     Default: .n42
```

Some programs are more tolerant than others when processing potentially invalid
N42 inputs. This utility can be used to check data file compliance with the N42
specification. Output can be constrained to valid or invalid files only, with
optional detailed information about which elements of the file are incorrect.

### n42www.py

```
usage: n42www.py [-h] [-b IP] [-m NUM] [-p PORT] [-v]

options:
  -h, --help                show this help message and exit
  -b IP, --bind-addr IP     IP address on which to listen [127.0.0.1]
  -m NUM, --max-size NUM    Maximum upload file size in bytes [131072]
  -p PORT, --port PORT      Port on which to listen [6853]
  -v, --verbose             increase verbosity for debugging
```

This program is a simple web server which allows an RC XML file to be `POST`ed
to its `/convert` endpoint, returning an N42 file. This enables radiation analysis
to be conducted using just an RC detector, and a phone or tablet running the
[RadiaCode](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.almacode.radiacode)
and
[InterSpec](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=gov.sandia.interspec)
apps.

Configuring a reverse proxy and `WSGI` server for safe deployment of this server
is beyond the scope of this document.

### radiacode_poll.py

```
usage: radiacode_poll.py [-h] [-b MAC] [--accumulate-time TIME] [--accumulate] [-R] [--reset-dose]

options:
  -h, --help              show this help message and exit
  -b MAC, --btaddr MAC    Bluetooth address of device; leave blank to use USB
  --accumulate            Measure until interrupted with ^C
  --accumulate-time TIME  Measure for a given amount of time (hh:mm:ss)
  --reset-spectrum        Reset accumulated spectrum. Dangerous.
  --reset-dose            Reset accumulated spectrum. Very Dangerous.
```

Poll a spectrum from a RadiaCode device. This script depends on the
[radiacode](https://github.com/cdump/radiacode) python module, but should work with
both bluetooth and USB connections. I've only tested this over USB though.

When run without accumulation, the current, in-memory, spectrum will be downloaded.
If either of the accumulation options are given, an initial spectrum will be captured
and the script will delay. At the end of the delay, another spectrum will be captured
and the intial spectrum will be subtracted. This will not reset the device state.

Two options are given to reset the in-memory spectrum and the total accumulated dose.
I'm calling them dangerous since they will delete data from device memory.

NB. Dose accumulation doesn't work yet.
